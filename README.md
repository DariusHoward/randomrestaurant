This program was made using xcode on my macbook. To my knowledge you need xcode to run the program properly. 
I plan to record a video of how the app works because inteviewers in the past have had issues getting the project to run. 

Thisprogram is for people who have a hard time choosing somewhere to eat. I did this because sometimes you eat at the same places constantly and want to switch up your restaurant of choice. The application is pretty simple it has a button that you use to select a restaurant and if you like that restaurant than you go to that restaurant to eat if you do not like the choice hit the button again.

The inspiration for this program comes from some friends and I struggling on choosing places to eat because some of us had already eaten at a certain place a lot during that week.

Also, here are the resources I used:
